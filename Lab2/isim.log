ERROR: at 170 ns(10000): Iteration limit 10000 is reached. Possible zero delay oscillation detected where simulation can not advance in time because signals can not resolve to a stable value in File "D:/Training_Program/Lab/Lab2/Bit_counting.v" Line 153. Please correct this code in order to advance past the current simulation time.
